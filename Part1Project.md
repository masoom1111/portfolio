# The *Tail* of 2 Vaccines: From Polio to COVID

## Project Outline

The outline covers the basic skeleton of the project, that I would like to cover in my project. It covers several points that I intend to incorporate in my project, however it may change as per the data acquired and visualization capability.

### Summary

My project aims to deep dive into the analysis of 2 vaccines (Polio and COVID) from two different era's. It intends to identify their similarities, differences and highlight any lessons which can be learnt and applied in the near future by looking at various factors from each of their timeline. 

### Structure

I hope to achieve determination in the viewer, of taking the vaccine(s) and future booster doses. Also, to make them realise that there is no sure-shot success formula in a vaccine and gradually with time, the efficacy will improve and COVID will be eventually eradicated. Currently, people are still relying and being victim of conspiracy theories regarding COVID and do not believe in the vaccine. Also, they are comparing Polio's success with COVID and undermining COVID, without realising that they both are not Apple to Apple comparison. 

First I want the viewer to understand current Polio's scenario. This can be done by showing the number of active cases of Polio in the world. To specify the region/country a graphical map visualization will be the most effective.

Then I would want to make the viewer be accustomed to the Polio Timeline. A dynamic line chart can be used here, with major milestones surrounding the timeline. The data on the timeline will be of number of cases and also highlighting the mortality rate along with vaccine milestones.. This will help them glance at see the effect of vaccinations on the case rate and subsquent effect on mortality rate.

Once, Polio is established, gradually making the comparsion with COVID timeline, will make the viewer compare and contrast both the scenarios and illuminate the similarity and differences.

Next, I would like the viewer to also shift focus from statistics to emotional factor that was bounded with the timeline i.e. the trust rate of the public and how it played/plays a big role in the conspiracy theories of COVID.

Lastly, I will want to predict the future of COVID vaccination, if and when everyone pledges to accept and take the COVID vaccine(s) and future booster doses. This will make the emotional factor end on a high and leave the viewer with a motivation and maybe nudge them to make others aware and join the pledge too.
