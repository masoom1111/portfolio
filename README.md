# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.

## About me
This is **Masoom Patel**. I am a Master's student in **Information Systems Management** at **Carnegie Mellon University**. Having a bachelors in **Computer Science**, I am confident that I have the analytical skills with a blend of managerial skills. Interning at _United Nations Development Programme_ as a **Data Management and Visualization** intern gave me the exposure and experience in dealing with data visually. Visualization is a powerful tool and I wish to add it in my arsenal of skills, refining it and being in par with the latest technologies.

## What I hope to learn
I wish to further develop my Visualization skills via this course along with:
* Use data efficiently so that it's simple to interpret yet conveys meaning
* Learn different tools like Shorthand, Tableau, Github and more
* Understand the audience and how to develop customised visualizations for the particular audience
* Learn how to efficiently _critique_ my visualizations

I plan to work as Data Analyst and deal with creating dashboards and visualizations and use them to make informed decisions for the organisation I work for. 

For example I would like to achieve this for my visualizations, eventually:
