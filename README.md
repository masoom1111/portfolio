This is **Masoom Patel** and my pronouns are he/him. I am a Master's student in **Information Systems Management** at **Carnegie Mellon University**. Having a bachelors in **Computer Science**, I am confident that I have the analytical skills with a blend of managerial skills. Interning at _United Nations Development Programme_ as a **Data Management and Visualization** intern gave me the exposure and experience in dealing with data visually. Visualization is a powerful tool and I wish to add it in my arsenal of skills, refining it and being in par with the latest technologies.

Apart from the academics, you can always find me either working out or playing sports. I love travelling and hence was part of the Global track at CMU, where I got to experience both it's campuses, Australia and Pittsburgh. I am a firm believer of the quote 'If it is not impossible, then I will make it possible'.

## What I hope to learn
I wish to further develop my Visualization skills via this course along with:
* Use data efficiently so that it's simple to interpret yet conveys meaning
* Learn different tools like Shorthand, Tableau, Github and more
* Understand the audience and how to develop customised visualizations for the particular audience
* Learn how to efficiently _critique_ my visualizations

I plan to work as Data Analyst and deal with creating dashboards and visualizations and use them to make informed decisions for the organisation I work for. Eventually, I want to gradually merge into a managerial position in the tech sector.
