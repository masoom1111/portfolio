#Assignment 3&4

This assignment served a purpose to find a visualization -> Critique it -> Wireframe your solution -> Get First Hand Feedback -> Final Implementation (Revamped Viz)
Here's the process I followed:

##The Original Visualization
I am a huge cricket fan, so the first place I encounter lots of visualization is on cricket articles. ESPN Cricinfo, being one of the most popular ones, I was searching and found a 2015 article. The context of this article in a nutshell: India vs. Australia (World Cup Semifinal) and is India prepared for this encounter?

##Critique Phase
First of all, looking at the visualization, you would wonder *"WOW" looks fancy!, there cannot be anything wrong with this visualization*. This was the aim for this visualization, to catch the audience's eye. It does that really well, getting a top score in engagement and visual aesthetics. However does it tell you a story? Are the numbers clear? Or your only focus is on those fancy cricket shots?

The Critique google form filled contains the major chunk of my answers on the above questions and additional critiques for the viz. 
But to summarise them here:
