# The Tail of 2 Vaccines: From Polio to COVID (Part 3)

## Audience

As per the clarity and confirmation received from the Part 2 User Research Feedback, my audience was the unvaccinated i.e. the man-in-the-middle, who are still unsure whether they should get the vaccine or not. Also, people who are procrastinating their booster shot after getting vaccinated were also the audience, as I showed cases spiking with the new variants, Delta and Omicron, and taking a booster shot is essential if we are aiming for Herd Immunity, as shown in my future vaccine prediction visualization. 

Also to connect with the audience, I have incorporated a style of asking questions, they might have in their mind while seeing a particular visualization and a pattern. Supporting it with my data and following visualizations, I have attempted to answer these questions. 
For instance: "So what's the point of taking the vaccine? (with rising cases post-vaccination)"
Supported by the infographic Visualization showing Unvaccinated people are more likely to die

Another aspect I delved to reignite the trust in the man-in-the-middle audience (those are swaying with the public opinion). So, I asked the question "Makes you rethink, whom should you trust?". This was followed up by the Trust Rate Line chart of the USA and how it changed over the years, with few main events, leading to this change. 

Lastly, ending on a high as per my mood board, using the current trend to predict the future using Tableau Statistics to an optimum level, I was able to provide a visualization per state-wise in the USA and for the USA in general. Giving a date, makes the audience aim for something and have a target in mind, and make them feel a sense of accomplishment if they are part of it.

With a clear call to action of providing resources so the audience is able to sign up for their first/second vaccine shot or for a booster shot.

## Summary

My journey on this particular topic of COVID started back in the course of *Communicating with COVID: To Build Trust and take Action*. Here we were dealing with how we can learn from the past and use those lessons to rebuild trust and make informed policy decisions. This is where Polio came in, even though Polio and COVID are not Apple-to-Apple comparisons, we always associate Polio with a successful vaccination drive. This definitely meant there could be something COVID is doing wrong or something COVID can learn from Polio and make people believe in the COVID vaccine as they did for the Polio Vaccine. 

Now, the next step was to gather data. With COVID data it was not too tough, as there are plenty of resources that have COVID data. However, identifying reliable sources was essential, so the data is as accurate as possible. Regarding Polio, Country/State-wise data was not available, however, World data was available as shown in Part 2. 

In Part 1 I was able to sketch out the rough storyline I would like to tell with supporting visualizations. I had all the points placed on showing the current Polio Cases, comparing the timeline of Polio and COVID, trust rate, and future prediction. This made me clear and it automatically derived to a coherent call of action of *Taking the Vaccine*.

In Part 2, while I started building the wireframes and a few visualizations, the user research feedback aligned with my audience in mind. The main takeaways I implemented apart from changing the aesthetic of the visualizations (color, font, etc) were 'Adding negatives of not taking the vaccine' and 'Making the polio and COVID story more coherent, by acknowledging and saying why should they trust?'

This is when I decided to incorporate the aspect of the Death Rate. Creating the infographic on 'infograph' of human figures of Vaccinated vs Unvaccinated and its death rate, will make the audience understand what happens if you don't take the vaccine addressing the above takeaway. Also asking Questions and providing Answers, made the acknowledgment of why Polio and how it's different/similar to COVID.

The feedback I received from Professor and TA regarding adding text and context, so the audience can make more sense of particular terms like 'Wild Polio' or 'Vaccine-derived', etc. So after Part 2, I worked on adding text and takeaways from each Visualization, so the audience can understand it wholly. I also added Quotes, to highlight the main points in the body of the texts.  

### Personal Takeaway and Reflection

Overall, this project has made me understand and go through the process of leveraging data in a meaningful way, that a story is being told. But, like all stories, there needs to be something that the audience learns i.e. the Call to Action in this case. It was as vital as the whole process, without a concrete Call to Action, all the effort is in vain. 
Apart from this, I have learned how to critique a visualization and make it tell its own stand-alone story, even if the bigger picture is taken out. 
Exploring various tools and platforms, I have added a lot of arsenal to my visualization skills and this makes me strive to learn more by applying all that I have learned in my future work.
