### This grid of line charts visualization is an interactive side by side comparison of each country over the years. Visualization showcases each country's debt as a % of their GDP. Spanning over the years, in most countries we can identify an increasing trend of Debt over GDP. This can be a sign of caution for the countries, especially for Greece, Japan and USA.

### This treemap visualization is an interactive timeplay automised map. With the option of the play button, the visualization changes and shows the country's annual comparison of Debt-to-GDP ratio and helps identify the coutnries that have the worst/best GDP ratios over the years. It can help see the trend, without too many clicks, with a smooth flow which can be stopped, if additional detailed anlaysis is required at any particular year. We can see Japan with the worst ratio over the years, with Greece being a close second throughout. USA made into top 5 during the 2008 recession and was at it's worst in 2011.

### Treemap may feature multiple colors with the Rainbow colors, as they are easier on the eyes. As each country is unique, the colors signify this and can be used during the timeplay, to stick the eyes on one color and see their performance over the years.

# Comparing the Visuals

### The grid of line charts helps us visualize all the years at a glance for each country, and see it's trend specifically. On the other hand the treemap's interactive timeplay feature shows the major (i.e. worst performances) predominantly, with how the treemap is strucutred. It can be utilised in a more user-friendly way, as the biggest elements are always on the top left with smallest on bottom right, showing consistency and reduces eye travel when compared to grid of line of charts.
