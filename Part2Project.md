Questions  | Interviewee 1
------------- | -------------
Can you tell me what you think this is?  | It shows the journey of vaccines for polio as well as covid. 
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | This showcases a comparison of the polio vaccine with the covid vaccine with factors such as case rate, death rate. It also talks about aspects such as trust associated with vaccine.
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | It was interesting in the sense of inforing me about the countries where the polio cases are present today.
Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | The general public seems to be the target audience for this visualization. The focus can be on people who are hesitant to take the covid vaccine.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | The graphs could be a bit more coherent. It takes a minute to understand what's happening owing to the size of the graphs. It seems too congested in the first drafts of the graphs. Maybe the acknowlegement of why polio's vaccine journey has been compared to covid's vaccine journey could help users understand more as to why they should trust the vaccine.
