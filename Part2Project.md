## User Research and Interviews

### The Target Audience I hope to reach with the story

I am trying to target first of all, the man-in-the-middle i.e. the one's who are hesitant to take the Covid Vaccine. I feel this project might serve as the push, they might require to just get over the line and go get signed up for the covid shot. Hence, this is in connection with my call-to-action as showcased above in the rough draft of the Shorthand Storyboard, where I will be providng a link to the nearest Covid shot location or for online registration. Additionally, the audience I also would like to target are the ones who have taken the covid vaccine, but are procrastinating for the booster shot. The call to action will also have booster shot signup links or nearest location to get one.

### My approach to indentifying representative individuals to interview

I tried to find someone who has not yet been vaccinated, but kudos to our CMU community, almost 99% is vaccinated and finding that individual on-campus was tough. But, I tried to fill this void with my additional 4th interview slot, whom I specifically told to look at the project from the perspective of that you have not taken the covid-vaccine and have got a mindset that makes you repel against taking one. For my first 3 interviewees, I found all from different backgrounds, so its spread to a wider audience. And all of them have not yet taken the booster dose (even though they are eligible), but they have plenty of reasons to procrastinate (either being exams/thanksgiving holidays/ winter break etc). 

### Interview script and responses

Questions  | Interviewee 1 (MEIM Grad) | Interviewee 2 (MS in Mech) | Interviewee 3 (MISM grad) | Interviewee 4 (Mindset of Vaccine not taken)
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Can you tell me what you think this is?  | It shows the journey of vaccines for polio as well as covid. | Effectiveness of governments and policies on major pandemics/diseases portrayed using the prominent examples of polio and covid-19. | Analysing the disease trend and vaccine response of the polio disease with covid. | Shows the vaccine trend for Polio and Covid.
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | This showcases a comparison of the polio vaccine with the covid vaccine with factors such as case rate, death rate. It also talks about aspects such as trust associated with vaccine.| It is representing the trends of reported cases for polio and covid-19 with effects of vaccine trials and vaccine rollouts. | The visualisations showcase the case and death rates for covid and polio worldwide. It also depicts how these statistics are affected by the vaccine rollout and response. | It tells that everyone should take the vaccine
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | It was interesting in the sense of informing me about the countries where the polio cases are present today. | Polio cases rapidly decreased right after vaccine rollout but covid-19 cases again increased after the spread of the delta variant. I also think that this data is also proof that people's acceptance to polio vaccine was greater than covid-19 vaccine. | It is intriguining to see how polio took 30 years to be eradicated after the introduction of the vaccine and even to this date there are wild cases in some part of the world. Looking at the covid charts in the US, I found it confusing that the death rate was more or less the same before and after the introduction of the vaccine. I was also unable to guage the acceptance of the public to the vaccines through the shown visuals. | It took a lot of time for Polio to get eliminated even after introduction of vaccine
Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | The general public seems to be the target audience for this visualization. The focus can be on people who are hesitant to take the covid vaccine. | The intended audience is the general public who haven't take the vaccine shots yet, as this data representation is trying to bring awareness in the general public. | The general public is the intended audience. This could also be useful to policy makers to identify trends in the vaccine response. | The unvaccinated people
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | The graphs could be a bit more coherent. It takes a minute to understand what's happening owing to the size of the graphs. It seems too congested in the first drafts of the graphs. Maybe the acknowlegement of why polio's vaccine journey has been compared to covid's vaccine journey could help users understand more as to why they should trust the vaccine. | There could have been data for another pandemic level disease and the overall visual representation could have been more attractive to the general public. | The covid data is only representative of US citizens. Since the polio visuals include trends for global data, I think there should be more detailed analysis for worldwide covid data as well.| I would like to see the negatives of not taking the vaccine.

### Finding from interviews
Firstly, my intended audience was aligned with what response the interviewees gave i.e. the general audience and those who are hesitant to take the vaccine. Secondly, the audience has been able to clearly interpret the visualizations and get the impact of how long the vaccines took to develop and see the death rate. Lastly, my transition of polio to covid was also appreciated and well recognised and the audience could understand where the call of action was being drived to. 


### Peer feedback from classroom group

The main things which came out here was the storyline looked coherent. Some nuances which were pointed were to make the labels horizontal in the timeline visualizations and bold them. Another suggestion was to make a timelapse of Polio cases over the year. Also to make the map colors coherent and avoiding the blue and making it red so its uniform throughout. 

### Changes I plan to implement for final project presentation

I plan to implement a historical drive in polio and focus on the negative effect of not taking a vaccine, so the audience can see the "LOW" and then transition into a "HIGH". I plan to make some tweaks in my labelling of certain visualizations and need to cite the images. The visualization should be in a new HTML section and not squeeze them with the text. Adding texts to support, would also be useful in some cases, to provide the audience with some takeaways. Some tweaks I plan to make is to add another interactive visualization, to show the negative impact, also if possible to showcase a worldwide data set for comparison of COVID with polio. Apart from that, I plan to make the trust rate visualization, like a timeline and get the user to ponder and resonate with the visualization. Lastly, the forecast shows a "HIGH" point they can witness in the future, with the herd immunity and then conlcude with the call of action.
