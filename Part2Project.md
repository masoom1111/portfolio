## User Research and Interviews

Questions  | Interviewee 1 (MEIM Grad) | Interviewee 2 (MS in Mech) | Interviewee 3 (MISM grad)
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Can you tell me what you think this is?  | It shows the journey of vaccines for polio as well as covid. | Effectiveness of governments and policies on major pandemics/diseases portrayed using the prominent examples of polio and covid-19. | Analysing the disease trend and vaccine response of the polio disease with covid.
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | This showcases a comparison of the polio vaccine with the covid vaccine with factors such as case rate, death rate. It also talks about aspects such as trust associated with vaccine.| It is representing the trends of reported cases for polio and covid-19 with effects of vaccine trials and vaccine rollouts. | The visualisations showcase the case and death rates for covid and polio worldwide. It also depicts how these statistics are affected by the vaccine rollout and response. 
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | It was interesting in the sense of informing me about the countries where the polio cases are present today. | Polio cases rapidly decreased right after vaccine rollout but covid-19 cases again increased after the spread of the delta variant. I also think that this data is also proof that people's acceptance to polio vaccine was greater than covid-19 vaccine. | It is intriguining to see how polio took 30 years to be eradicated after the introduction of the vaccine and even to this date there are wild cases in some part of the world. Looking at the covid charts in the US, I found it confusing that the death rate was more or less the same before and after the introduction of the vaccine. I was also unable to guage the acceptance of the public to the vaccines through the shown visuals.
Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | The general public seems to be the target audience for this visualization. The focus can be on people who are hesitant to take the covid vaccine. | The intended audience is the general public who haven't take the vaccine shots yet, as this data representation is trying to bring awareness in the general public. | The general public is the intended audience. This could also be useful to policy makers to identify trends in the vaccine response.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | The graphs could be a bit more coherent. It takes a minute to understand what's happening owing to the size of the graphs. It seems too congested in the first drafts of the graphs. Maybe the acknowlegement of why polio's vaccine journey has been compared to covid's vaccine journey could help users understand more as to why they should trust the vaccine. | There could have been data for another pandemic level disease and the overall visual representation could have been more attractive to the general public. | The covid data is only representative of US citizens. Since the polio visuals include trends for global data, I think there should be more detailed analysis for worldwide covid data as well.
