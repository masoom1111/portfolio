## User Research and Interviews

Questions  | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Can you tell me what you think this is?  | It shows the journey of vaccines for polio as well as covid. | Effectiveness of governments and policies on major pandemics/diseases portrayed using the prominent examples of polio and covid-19.
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | This showcases a comparison of the polio vaccine with the covid vaccine with factors such as case rate, death rate. It also talks about aspects such as trust associated with vaccine.| It is representing the trends of reported cases for polio and covid-19 with effects of vaccine trials and vaccine rollouts.
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | It was interesting in the sense of inforing me about the countries where the polio cases are present today. | Polio cases rapidly decreased right after vaccine rollout but covid-19 cases again increased after the spread of the delta variant. I also think that this data is also proof that people's acceptance to polio vaccine was greater than covid-19 vaccine. 
Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | The general public seems to be the target audience for this visualization. The focus can be on people who are hesitant to take the covid vaccine. | The intended audience is the general public who haven't take the vaccine shots yet, as this data representation is trying to bring awareness in the general public.
Is there anything you would change or do differently? | The graphs could be a bit more coherent. It takes a minute to understand what's happening owing to the size of the graphs. It seems too congested in the first drafts of the graphs. Maybe the acknowlegement of why polio's vaccine journey has been compared to covid's vaccine journey could help users understand more as to why they should trust the vaccine. | There could have been data for another pandemic level disease and the overall visual representation could have been more attractive to the general public.
