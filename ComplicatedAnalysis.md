# Complicated Analysis
*By: Masoom Patel*

Q) Describe one of the most complicated analyses you have conducted in order to provide insight or convince. Please make sure to cover:

Brief on Project: I was doing a project regarding how Polio Vaccine can help us learn some lessons for the Covid Vaccine scenario.
 To make this clear and see how 


## 1. What made it complicated? 
The thing which made it complicated was that it was not an Apple to Apple comparison, understanding how Polio took place in a different era and how Covid is taking place currently.

## 2. Who did you present it to? 
It was presented to people in different fields, Policy Makers, Professors and Students.

## 3. What techniques did you use to convince (e.g. visualizations)? 
I used a comparison of both Polio and Covid via a timeline on Flourish. This visual representation helped us see what the journey of Polio was and derive insights based on it. Comparing it with COVID helps us see, how different COVID's journey was.

## Polio Timeline Viz:

## Covid Timeline Viz:

Also I used Tableau to see the current Polio status in the world.

4. Were you successful? Why or why not?

Yes, as these visualizations, gave us the clear picture of what the differences were amongst the vaccines.
In short the Takeaway the audience got was:
  a)Polio was already established for many years- before the vaccine trials started -> People were already aware of how deadly Polio was
  b)Polio's mortality rate was much higher than COVID, hence, people had lesser fear for COVID and still juggling with the conspiracy theories
  c)Polio vaccine took 20 years to develop, compared to COVID in around 6 months (40:1 ratio).
